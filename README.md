# hello-world
Learning html and working with GitHub for the purpose of Harvard's "CS50â€™s Web Programming with Python and JavaScript".

Feel like a vegetable on the world, and my time is mostly dedicated into videogames, which is not productive for the amount of time I spend on it. I need to do something in my life otherwise the game is over with low xp.

I got motivated while I watched Lecture 0 and the exploring I had to do in order to "finish" Project 0 in a way that made me travel into my childhood, and that's a good path. In the end, I'm learning and making my brain occupied with something valueable.
